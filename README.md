# Code Refactor Starter Code
Urban Octo Telegram  is a website I had to fix to meet accessibility standards.

To begin, semantic html elements had to be added because the starting code had div everywhere and it was confusing to tell what was what.
Then the alt attribute was added to the images beacause there werent any to begin with.
An id was added to search engine optimization to connect it to the href.
When it comes to the css the first thing I did was move the elements so they would be in the same order as the html file. Then some of the classes had to be condensed down to one element so it wouldnt have more code than it needed.

The link for the website is https://abydiaz.github.io/first-challenge/urban-octo-telegram-main/Develop/
